# Bio-ML projects
Small and various Biology & Machine Learning projects under exploration, experimentation, and development.

### [biomarker](./biomarker): 
- A binary classifier on a biomarker to predict disease status. 

### [clinical report](./clinical_report): 
- NLP task to analyze clinical trial reports.
    - Classify sentences from clinical trials and 
    - Extract important entities (Drug Name, Symptom, Dosage).

### [differential expression](./differential_exppression):
- Explore gene expression data to identify differentially expressed genes between treatment and control conditions.

### [chemical compounds](./chemical_compounds):
- A Python tool to read chemical compounds in SMILES string, apply customizable filters, compute elemental counts, and generate curated outputs efficiently.
